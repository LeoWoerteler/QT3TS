<h1 style="text-align: center;">XQuery/XPath/XSLT 3.* Test Suite</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The XQuery/XPath/XSLT 3.* Test Suite (QT3TS) provides a set of metrics for determining
  whether the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-30/">W3C XML Query Language, version 3.0</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-30/">W3C XML Path Language, version 3.*</a>, 
  and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/">W3C XSL Transformation Language, 
  version 3.*</a> can be implemented interoperably as published.</p>
  
  <p>QT3TS will help implementers
  identify possible problems both with the Specifications and with their
  implementations of those Specifications. The test suite is occasionally updated to reflect the current work
  of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Query">W3C XML Query Working Group</a>
  and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/">W3C XSLT Working Group</a>; all
  releases of the QT3TS will be available from this page.</p>

<p>XQuery 3.0 is (for most purposes) a superset of XPath 3.0, with the exception of the namespace
axis. As such, this test suite tests all of XPath 3.0. These XPath
3.0 test cases are identified in the test suite catalog.</p>

<p>Very many of the tests are converted automatically from tests in the older XQuery Test Suite.
There are several changes in approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>in most cases the test query is now inline within the catalog,
making it much easier to find all the tests for a given area and to add new tests</li>
<li>the mechanisms for testing results are more flexible: instead of being confined to
comparing serialized output of a query, it is now possible to make an arbitrary number
of assertions about the result. This gives much greater flexibility in handling queries
where aspects of the result are implementation defined (for example, the order of items
in the result)</li>
<li>the dependencies each the test are more clearly defined in the metadata. Each test refers 
to a named environment which in turn defines resources such as source documents and schemas
used by the test: this allows resources used by multiple tests to be shared, without making
all resources global. In addition, each test states its assumptions about the specification
language and features that it depends on: for example a test might be labelled as XP20+ to indicate
that it requires XPath 2.0 or later, or as XQ10 to indicate that it is only expected to be
run with XQuery 1.0 and not with any later version. Test drivers can either use this information
to configure an XPath/XQuery processor that meets the expectations, or they can use it to decide
which tests it is approprriate to run. When reported test results are tabulated, they
will be tabulated separately for each optional feature, so a processor that implements only
XQuery 3.0 and not XQuery 1.0 will not be listed in the tabulation for XQuery 1.0.</li>
</ol>

<p>Currently the test suite is work in progress. There are no versioned releases, instead
the tests are continuously updated in the CVS repository. This will change as the specifications
themselves stabilize, at which point snapshots of this test suite will be frozen and given
version numbers.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, QT3TS contains over 22,000 test cases. It contains a catalog that
contains general information on the test suite as well as test descriptions for
each of the test cases included in this release. Test queries and assertions about the expected
results are contained in the catalog, or in some cases in files referenced from the catalog. All interpretations of these
Recommendations are subject to confirmation by the XML Query Working Group and
the XSLT Working Group.</p>

<p>The tests are organised into a number of groups, each with its own naming conventions.</p>

<ul>
<li>fn: tests of functions in Functions and Operators, one per function, named according to the function</li>
<li>op: tests of operators in Functions and Operators, one per operator, named according to the operator</li>
<li>math: tests of the functions in the math namespace</li>
<li>map: tests of the facilities in the XSL WG maps proposal (which is not currently part of XPath or XQuery)</li>
<li>prod: tests of XPath and XQuery language features, named after a production in the XPath/XQuery grammar that
is most relevant to the test in question (for example CastExpr or CompAttrConstructor)</li>
<li>xs: tests of specific data types</li>
<li>misc: tests for capabilities that are orthogonal to specific language features, for example error handling,
support for different XML editions, or support for non-BMP unicode characters.</li>
<li>app: tests of XPath/XQuery "applications", that is, queries designed to accomplish some applicatation-oriented
goal, rather than merely to test individual language constructs. These include tests harvested from the
published use cases, from the XMark benchmark suite, and from Priscilla Walmsley's functx library,
and also a number of tests whose main purpose is to validate the integrity of the test catalog itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a master catalog, <code>catalog.xml</code>, that contains references to subsidiary
catalogs, one per test area, organized in directories as above. There are some additional directories:</p>

<ul>
<li>docs: contains source documents and schemas used globally throughout the test suite</li>
<li>tools: contains a miscellany of tools used for preparing or analyzing tests</li>
<li>drivers: contains a selection of contributed test drivers that may be used as a starting point
for writing new test drivers</li>
</ul>


<p>Implementors are encouraged 1) to write a harness for this test suite and to
test their implementations and 2) to report their results to the XML Query
Working Group. All of these areas are discussed in greater detail below.</p>

<p>This document serves as a first point of information for all interested
parties. A general account of current activities, finalized work, and pointers
to further information is given. In the sections below, you will be able to get
a good view of the status of the QT3TS, and if you are interested in something
in particular you are invited to follow the appropriate link given below.</p>

<h1>Status</h1>

<p>The XQuery/XPath/XSLT 3.0 Test Suite has not yet been fully developed. 
It already incorporates all tests (or functional replacements) from the 
<a href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2006/xquery-test-suite/">XML Query 1.0 test suite</a>, 
as well as many new tests designed to test new features of XQuery 3.0, XPath 3.0, and XSLT 3.0. 
To enable tracking of test history, including controversies that may have arisen in the past
about the correctness of test results, all test names of XQuery 1.0 tests have been
retained unchanged.</p>

<h2>Accessing our Source Files</h2>

<p>Our source files are available at <a
href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2011/QT3-test-suite/">http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2011/QT3-test-suite/</a>.
This page provides the ability to view individual files.</p>

<p>If you want to get the latest version of the test suite, but don't intend to make any contributions,
you can use anonymous CVS to check the whole suite out into your local filestore. Use the
CVS repository name <code>:pserver:anonymous@dev.w3.org:/sources/public</code>, password <code>anonymous</code>,
and the module name <code>2011/QT3-test-suite</code>.</p>

<p>To work on the test suite you will need to get read-write access to the W3C CVS repository. Official
information on how to do this is at <a href="https://www.w3.org/Project/CVSdoc/">https://www.w3.org/Project/CVSdoc/</a>;
unofficial information from people who have been through the experience and emerged from it triumphant is 
<a href="http://wiki.csswg.org/spec/cvs">here</a> (Tantek Çelik) and 
<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xml-query-wg/2006Sep/0032.html">here</a> (Andrew Eisenberg).
Briefly the steps are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get a W3C username (ask your staff contact)</li>
<li>Create a private/public key pair and lodge the public half with W3C; wait until you get confirmation
that it has been installed.</li>
<li>Install a CVS client and configure it to be aware of your private/public key</li>
<li>Checkout the repository at <code>:ext:user@dev.w3.org:/sources/public</code> (where 'user' is your username), 
module (or directory) <code>2011/QT3-test-suite</code>. Note that many CVS clients invite you to ask the server for
a list of available modules, but the W3C server does not respond to this request: you need to
know the name of the module you are looking for.</li>
</ol>

<p>Two graphical CVS clients I (Michael Kay) have found useful are: for Windows, <b>TortoiseCVS</b>, and for Mac, <b>SmartCVS</b>.
Use the command line if you're feeling macho; use Emacs if you are one of the faithful. Other tools that you have on your desktop
may also have a CVS client built in, though the number is declining as CVS is now considered obsolescent.</p>

<p>Other guides you may find useful are Andrew Eisenberg's at <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xml-query-wg/2006Sep/0032.html">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xml-query-wg/2006Sep/0032.html</a>
</p>

<p>If you are new to CVS, here are some explanations of key terms:</p>

<ul>
<li>checkout: checking out a repository is something you only do once, when you first access that repository on a new client machine.
It makes a copy of the repository in your local filestore. It doesn't give you any kind of lock.</li>
<li>update: refresh your local filestore copy of the data with updated information from the server</li>
<li>commit: send your changes back to the server</li>
<li>add: mark a local file or directory for inclusion in the repository next time you commit (an operation that is very easy to forget)</li>
<li>conflict: two people have been working on the same file, and the system can't work out how to merge the changes. If you get a conflict
on commit, try an update, and the system will give you a chance to merge the changes. Better, avoid conflicts
by updating and committing frequently, and by talking to your colleagues about what you are doing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Development Process</h2>


<p>At the current stage of development, the change control process for tests is
lightweight. New tests can be submitted by anyone who has CVS access, without formality.
If you modify existing tests, you are expected to use your discretion. For something that
is clearly 'editorial', for example expanding the description of what a test
does or formatting the query to make it more readable, feel free to fix it silently. 
If you are fixing something more substantive, for example
changing the test to conform to a recent decision of the working group, or fine-tuning the test assertions, then add metadata to
record your change (with an element of the form <code>&lt;modified by="my name" on="2011-12-25" change="what I did"/&gt;</code>).
If you think the test is substantively wrong but if there is any possibility that others might disagree with
you, then raise a bug report against the test before changing it. If you are convinced that the
test is substantively wrong and you are convinced no-one will disagree (for example, because you are the world's expert
on this area of the spec, or because it is your test), then raise a bug report, and close it immediately
to record the fact that you have fixed it. The bug report should include the test name for ease
of searching.</p>

<p>If at all possible, test your tests against at least one implementation before committing them. 
Experience shows that untested tests have a 50% chance of being wrong.</p>

<p>Where possible, make your CVS commits fine-grained, and mention bug numbers and/or test names in the commit message.</p>

<p>This process will become more formal as the tests and the spec approach completion.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The primary documentation of the test suite (alongside this document) is the schema for the catalog and test-set files,
    which is found at <a href="catalog-schema.xsd">catalog-schema.xsd</a>. If viewed directly in an XSLT-capable browser,
    the schema is rendered automatically into HTML. In case this mechanism does not work, a pre-rendered version of the HTML
is at <a href="catalog-schema.html">catalog-schema.html</a>. (In many browsers the pre-rendered form is more readable).</p>

<h1>Running the Test Suite</h1>

<p>We encourage you, the implementors of XQuery and XQueryX, to run these tests
and send us your results. These results will help us exit Candidate
Recommendation (described in the W3C <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/">Process</a>).</p>

<p>As there is no de jure or de facto API for implementations of XQuery 1.0, we
are not able to provide a test harness to execute these tests. You will have to
write your own test harnesses.</p>

<p>We have provided <a
href="Guidelines%20for%20Running%20the%20XML%20Query%20Test%20Suite.html">Guidelines
for Running the XML Query Test Suite</a> to assist you in running these tests.
These guidelines will tell you how the queries may be modified before they are
executed and how to compare your actual results with the expected results that
we have provided. At one time we solicited submissions of test cases from
individuals and organizations that were not already participating in the XML
Query Working Group. You may find a document that we prepared, <a
href="Guidelines%20for%20Test%20Submission.html">Guidelines for XML Query Test
Suite Submissions</a>, useful.</p>

<h2>Reporting a Problem</h2>

<p>If you believe that some of the queries or their expected results are
incorrect, then we encourage you to enter bug reports in the public instance of
Bugzilla at W3C, <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/">http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/</a>. To
enter a bug report you will need a Bugzilla signon (email address and
password). You can create this singon by following the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/createaccount.cgi">Open a new Bugzilla
account</a> link on the Bugzilla Main Page.</p>

<p>General information on Bugzilla, an open-source bug tracking system, is
available at <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">http://www.bugzilla.org/</a>.
The standard documentation for the version currently being run on the W3C
server is available at <a
href="http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/2.20/html/">http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/2.20/html/</a>.</p>

<p>To enter a bug report in Bugzilla you will need to log in, choose the action
"New", and then choose the "XML Query Test Suite" product. Please be specific
about the problem that you are reporting. Clearly identify the test case or
test cases that are problematic. If you believe that the expected result is
wrong, then tell us what result you believe is correct. If you believe that
another result for a test case is justified, then please tell us what it is. In
both cases, please cite portions of one or more of the XQuery specifications
that support your position.</p>

<h1>Submission of Test Suite Results</h1>

<p>When you are ready to submit your results to us, we ask that you follow the
guidelines provided in <a
href="Guidelines for Submitting XQTS Test Results.html">Guidelines for
Submitting XML Query Test Suite Results</a>. These guidelines will tell you how
to generate an XML result document that we can use to generate our reports.
They will also tell you how to generate your own report from the XML result
file.</p>

<p>If you have indicated that you wish your results to be displayed as
&ldquo;Anonymous&rdquo;, then please send them to the XML Query WG Team
Contact, <a href="mailto:liam@w3.org">Liam Quin</a>, cc'ing <a
href="mailto:w3t-archive@w3.org">w3t-archive@w3.org</a>. Otherwise, please send
them to the XML Query WG co-chair, <a
href="mailto:andrew.eisenberg@us.ibm.com">Andrew Eisenberg</a>, cc'ing <a
href="mailto:www-archive@w3.org">www-archive@w3.org</a>.</p>

<p>We encourage you to send us results early, and then to send us updates as
the XQTS progresses and as your implementation progresses.</p>
-->

<!--
<h1>Submission of Test Cases</h1>

<p>We welcome submissions of test cases from individuals and organizations
that are not already participating in the XML Query Working Group. We
encourage you to look at <a
href="Guidelines%20for%20Test%20Submission.html">Guidelines for XML Query
Test Suite Submissions</a> so that the test cases that you submit can be
added easily to our test suite.</p>

<p>If you would like to submit test cases, then you must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Register for a W3C account. You can request one through the <a
    href="http://cgi.w3.org/MemberAccess/Public">Public Access Request
    Form</a>.</li>
  <li>Submit your test cases using <a>Grant II: Grant of License for
    Contributed Test Cases Published Outside a W3C Recommendation</a>. This
    license grant, for non-Participant test case Contributors, is described
    in <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/10/27-testcases.html">Policies for
    Contribution of Test Cases to W3C</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The XML Query Working Group and XSL Working Group will, at their sole
discretion, determine what tests are incorporated in the test suite.</p>
